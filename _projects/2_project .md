Microservice Mission Management Module, Linear Infrastructure Inspection (LiMIC)

Drones 4 Safety is a project developing a cooperative, autonomous, operating drone system to enhance transport
safety. To support this project Linear-Infrastructure Mission Control (LiMiC) is being developed as a cloud service.
From a UI, an operator can plan and control the continuos missions, inspecting the infrastructure. This thesis
circles around the mission management part of LiMiC, serving as an API, that the UI can call. Designing and
implementing relational databases with geospatial functionality is covered in both theoretical and practical details.
The two databases is serving three dedicated microservices serving a REST API, needed the mission management
software. Through the thesis the services is described in detail, handling questions about dependencies, internal
architecture, performance and asynchronous-execution and database connections. Further the deployment aspect
of microservices is described. Both the theoretical and practical parts is described in detail. All in all giving a
working solution, a platform, to the problem statement that this thesis is all about.

The thesis was graded 12 (ETCS A).
