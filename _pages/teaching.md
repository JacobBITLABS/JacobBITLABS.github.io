I was TA for the graduate computer vision course DM890 at SDU. 

<!-- https://odin.sdu.dk/sitecore/index.php?a=searchfagbesk&internkode=dm890&lang=en -->

<!-- Computer Vision is the study of enabling machines to "see" the visual world (i.e., understand images and videos). In this course, the students will learn fundamental computer vision algorithms and have opportunities to implement them. Further, we will be discussing more recent state-of-the-art visual representation learning approaches.

By successfully completing this course the students will be able to:
knowledge of a selection of basic image processing algorithms
knowledge of computer vision models and methods intended for applications
expert knowledge in a computer vision that is based on the highest international field of research within the field of computer science
to be able to understand and on a scientific basis reflect on the knowledge of the field of computer vision and be able to identify scientific issues
describe, analyze and solve advanced computer science problems using the learned models (current deep neural network (DNN) based approaches to basic image processing and computer vision)
describe, analyze and solve problems in computer vision, demonstrate awareness of the current key research issues in computer vision; learn to implement and train their own DNN models 
analyze advantages and disadvantages of different DNN architectures for image processing and computer vision
elucidate hypotheses made on a qualified theoretical background and be critical of one's own and others' research results and scientific models
plan and carry out scientific projects in computer vision at a high professional level
develop new variants of the learned methods where the specific problem requires it
disseminate research-based knowledge and discuss professional and scientific issues with both peers and non-specialists

This course builds upon the knowledge acquired in previous courses in programming and linear algebra.  -->
