I am a computer scientist from the University of Southern Denmark (SDU), specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Currently, I am employed as an industrial PhD student at Ordbogen A/S and SDU, supervised by Peter Schneider-Kamp, Lukas Galke and Melih Kandemir. I primarily work with efficient deep learning in all aspects from training to inference. I am interested in many aspects and keep getting inspired, but examples are extreme quantization aware training and inference, distributed training optimization, optimizers and understanding and using latent spaces in the optimization process.  
<!-- Before i worked as an AI/ML Engineer at Ordbogen A/S’s RnD department working on various AI products, but extensively in natural language processing. Responsible for turning existing research into products, conducting our own research in co-operation with universities, supervising master’s students and summer-interns from various universities, including Massachusetts In- stitute of Technology (MIT) -->
